---

Week 1 Plan: 
- [x] Implement the backend part of the ability for respondents to add comments for MCQ questions
- [x] Implement the frontend part of comments feature for students

Works
- 1st review ready at https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830#issuecomment-391105329

Retrospect on Week 1:
Most of the week 1 went into understanding the comments feature for instructors and implementing the same for students.
Previous closed PR on this issue helped a lot in this regard. 
I learnt working with JSP and tag files. There were instances when I felt I had completely broken the project.
Debugging was the hardest part in this week.

Week 2 Plan:
- [x] Accomodate student comments in instructor results page (All views)
- [x] Implement the ability to edit and delete comments

Works
- 2nd review ready at https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830#issuecomment-392290459

Retrospect on Week 2:
Week 1 made me quite comfortable to make further changes. This was the week when I made lots of changes in the code owing to dreaded Null Pointer Exception.
I spent a day trying to figure out reason for Malformed Url Exception but in vain. Finally I left it as it is and continued make other changes. Somehow surprisingly this error went away after few commits in travis build but not on my development environment. 
I think I spent more time debugging my code than actually adding new code. So I learnt to be more careful while writing code to avoid mistakes that would cost me much more time because of debugging.

Week 3 Plan:
- [x] Add comments column to CSV 
- [x] Add tests for MCQ

Works
- 3rd review ready at https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830#issuecomment-393665433

Retrospect on Week 3
Adding tests was easiest part. I spent most of the time fixing the failing tests. I felt that in last three weeks, reviews were not as consisent as thought it would be. I believe this was due to unavailability of senior mentor. 
I utilised this time to try improve my code. I really enjoyed testing the new feature and I am looking forward to getting this PR merged by next week.

Week 4 Plan:
- [x] Finish any remaining work from week 1-3
- [ ] Fix issues after code review

Works
- Opened new issue and PR [Instructor: comment on responses: support entering comments for each response from view GQR #8872](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8897)

Retrospect on Week 4:
Code review couldn't be done in this week so I worked upon feature to support entering comments for each response from view Giver-Question-Recipient which was to be done in Week 10. It is almost done. Adding tests is remaining.

Week 5 Plan:
- [ ] Implement the ability for respondents to add comments for numerical-scale questions
- [ ] Implement the ability for respondents to add comments for MSQ questions
- [ ] Implement the ability for respondents to add comments for rank questions
- [ ] Add tests for trio

Works
- Merged PR [Instructors: sessions page: fix 'resend link to view results'](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8827)
- 3rd review ready [Student: view results: rank questions: show average](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8784#issuecomment-397224861)

Retrospect on Week 5:
First half of the week I majorly worked upon above mentioned PRs. I got review on main ongoing PR in second half of the week. I learnt I should remember to add Javadoc for majority of new functions that I add. There were some major changes suggested by mentor Xiao, which will take some time to implement. Since the PR is huge, many iterations of review is expected. I couldn't complete this week's plan because I underestimated the time required for reviewing and fixing code after that.

Week 6 Plan:
- [x] Code Review

Works
- Worked majorly upon fixing code after reviews.

Retrospect on Week 6:
This week had a steep learning curve. Through code reviews, I learnt better coding practices. There were no major roadblocks.

Week 7 Plan:
- [x] Code Review

Works
- Worked majorly upon fixing code after reviews.
- Review ready PR [Instructor: comment on responses: support entering comments for each response from view GQR #8872](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8897)
- Opened PR [Instructor: Question view: visibility icon does not appear for new comments #8899](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8934)

Retrospect on Week 7:
Code looks clean now. I guess it would take some more time to get the main PR merged. I plan to work on this along with other issues related to comments feature.

Week 8 Plan:
- [x] Code Review
- [x] Ability for instructors to add comments from view, Giver > Question > Recipient
- [ ] Ability for instructors to add comments from view, Recipient > Question > Giver
- [ ] Add tests for both

Works
- Review ready PR [Instructor: Question view: visibility icon does not appear for new comments #8899](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8934)
- Review ready PR [Student: submit responses: allow student to add a comment for each response #7239](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830#issuecomment-402225344)
- Review ready PR [Student: submit responses: allow student to add a comment for each response #7239](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830#issuecomment-402678276)

Retrospect on Week 8:
This week I worked upon another issue related to comments feature along with main comments PR. I faced two difficulties this week. First one, I encountered lots of unrelated errors after pulling from master as there were updates in development packages. It was some problem caused by intelliJ. Second being failing test on master branch. My mentors helped me solve both the issues quickly so that time is not wasted. And both of them were related to intelliJ. Adding ability for instructors to add comments from view RQG is same as GQR PR. Once GQR PR gets merged, it wouldn't take much time to do same for RQG.

Week 9 Plan:
- [ ] Implement the ability for respondents to add comments for numerical-scale questions
- [ ] Implement the ability for respondents to add comments for MSQ questions
- [ ] Implement the ability for respondents to add comments for rank questions
- [ ] Update UI for response comments
- [ ] Add tests for trio

Works
- Merged PR [Instructor: Question view: visibility icon does not appear for new comments #8899](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8934)
- Review ready PR [Student: submit responses: allow student to add a comment for each response #7239](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830#issuecomment-403317501)
- Review ready PR [Student: submit responses: allow student to add a comment for each response #7239](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830#issuecomment-404215861)
- Review ready PR [Student: submit responses: allow student to add a comment for each response #7239](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830#issuecomment-405013606)

Retrospect on Week 9:
This week I worked upon making comments on responses PR backward compatible. I enjoyed discussing with mentors about ways we can ensure that legacy data is handled. I saw few of the old data migration scripts which was pretty amazing. I previously thought that data migration is something extremely complicated. But now I wish to write one myself for comments feature in future. In my GQR PR, there were logic holes in my previous implementation which got discovered during review. So I think I need to be more careful and think deeply so as to avoid writing bad logic in future.  I couldn't complete this week's plan because there is still lot of room for improvement in comments PR and current week's plan can only be completed after main PR gets merged.

Week 10 Plan:
- [ ] Implement the ability for respondents to add comments for rubric questions
- [ ] Implement the ability for respondents to add comments for distribute questions
- [ ] Update UI for response comments
- [ ] Add tests for both

Works
- Merged PR [Student: view results: rank questions: show average #8701](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8784)
- Review ready PR [Student: submit responses: allow student to add a comment for each response #7239](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830#issuecomment-405386280)

Retrospect on Week 10:
This week I worked upon separating feedback participant comments from instructor comments completely. It simplified the implementation of comment indexes. I also wrote lots of unit tests for all the new methods that I introduced in my multiple PRs. I feel more confident about writing tests at the end of this week. No major difficulties encountered. The reason for not completing this week's plan is same as the week before. Unfortunately I forgot to update my project plan last week.

Week 11 Plan:
- [x] Finish any remaining work from week 8-10
- [x] Fix issues after code review
- [ ] Implement backend of ability for instructors to disable comments

Works
- Merged PR [Instructor: comment on responses: support entering comments for each response from view GQR #8872 ](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8897)
- Merged PR [Instructor: comment on responses: support entering comments for each response from view RQG #8987 ](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8992)

Retrospect on Week 11:
This week I majorly worked upon fixing issues related to tests that I added last week in which I learnt to avoid introducing dependencies between tests as much as possible. There was also lot of discussion about overall UI of feedback comments feature. Current focus is on getting the basic feedback participant comments feature right, which means there wouldn't be any time left to work upon optional features.

Week 12 Plan:
- [x] Code review

Works
- Worked majorly upon fixing code after reviews.

Retrospect
This week went into refactoring the tests. Since it feedback particpants comments is a new feature, lots of tests need to to be added to make sure everything works fine. No major difficulties faced.

Week 13 Plan:
- [x] Code review

Works
- Merged PR [Student: submit responses: allow student to add a comment for each response #7239](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830)
- Merged PR [Student: Comment on responses: Fix put document error #9034](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9035)
- Merged PR [Student: comment on MCQ answers: replace cancel button with a delete button #9030](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9033)
- Merged PR [Student: comment on MCQ response: tweak comment UI #9029](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9036)
- Opened PR [Student: Allow adding comments to MSQ answers #9031](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9032)

Retrospect
- This week, I worked upon improving code quality of comments PR. Fortunately I stumbled upon a bug in comments PR before the release and managed to fix it as well as add more tests. I also worked upon extending comments feature to MSQ type questions. Upon discussion with mentors, it was decided to leave the work to enable other question types to other contributors (since the task is easy and there is already a good template for them to refer to) and I can be the reviewer. Adding feedback participant comments was a huge task for me and I am really happy to see the way it shaped up in three months.

Week 14 Plan:
- [ ] Improve UI of new comments feature

Suggestions for further work
- Enable feedback participant comments for other question types.
- Add ability to add feedback participant comments with response too.
- Add ability to set visibility settings of feedback participant comments.
- Allow instructors to disable feedback participant comments.
- Allow instructors to require feedback participant comments.
- Add ability to know if the instructor comment was read.
