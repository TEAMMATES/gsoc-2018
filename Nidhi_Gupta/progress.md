    * Distribute points (among options) question
    * Distribute points (among recipients) question
    * Rubric question
    * Rank (Options) question

Week 1 Plan: 
- [x] Implement the backend part of the ability for respondents to add comments for MCQ questions
- [x] Implement the frontend part of comments feature for students

Works
- 1st review ready at https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830#issuecomment-391105329

Retrospect on Week 1:
Most of the week 1 went into understanding the comments feature for instructors and implementing the same for students.
Previous closed PR on this issue helped a lot in this regard. 
I learnt working with JSP and tag files. There were instances when I felt I had completely broken the project.
Debugging was the hardest part in this week.

Week 2 Plan:
- [x] Accomodate student comments in instructor results page (All views)
- [x] Implement the ability to edit and delete comments

Works
- 2nd review ready at https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830#issuecomment-392290459

Retrospect on Week 2:
Week 1 made me quite comfortable to make further changes. This was the week when I made lots of changes in the code owing to dreaded Null Pointer Exception.
I spent a day trying to figure out reason for Malformed Url Exception but in vain. Finally I left it as it is and continued make other changes. Somehow surprisingly this error went away after few commits in travis build but not on my development environment. 
I think I spent more time debugging my code than actually adding new code. So I learnt to be more careful while writing code to avoid mistakes that would cost me much more time because of debugging.

Week 3 Plan:
- [x] Add comments column to CSV 
- [x] Add tests for MCQ

Works
- 3rd review ready at https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8830#issuecomment-393665433

Retrospect on Week 3
Adding tests was easiest part. I spent most of the time fixing the failing tests. I felt that in last three weeks, reviews were not as consisent as thought it would be. I believe this was due to unavailability of senior mentor. 
I utilised this time to try improve my code. I really enjoyed testing the new feature and I am looking forward to getting this PR merged by next week.

Week 4 Plan:
- [x] Finish any remaining work from week 1-3
- [ ] Fix issues after code review

Works
- Opened new issue and PR [Instructor: comment on responses: support entering comments for each response from view GQR #8872](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8897)

Retrospect on Week 4:
Code review couldn't be done in this week so I worked upon feature to support entering comments for each response from view Giver-Question-Recipient which was to be done in Week 10. It is almost done. Adding tests is remaining.

Week 5 Plan:
- [ ] Implement the ability for respondents to add comments for numerical-scale questions
- [ ] Implement the ability for respondents to add comments for MSQ questions
- [ ] Implement the ability for respondents to add comments for rank questions
- [ ] Add tests for trio

Works
- Merged PR [Instructors: sessions page: fix 'resend link to view results'](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8827)
- 3rd review ready [Student: view results: rank questions: show average](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8784#issuecomment-397224861)

Retrospect on Week 5:
First half of the week I majorly worked upon above mentioned PRs. I got review on main ongoing PR in second half of the week. I learnt I should remember to add Javadoc for majority of new functions that I add. There were some major changes suggested by mentor Xiao, which will take some time to implement. Since the PR is huge, many iterations of review is expected. I couldn't complete this week's plan because I underestimated the time required for reviewing and fixing code after that.

Week 6 Plan:
- [x] Code Review

Works
- Worked majorly upon fixing code after reviews.

Retrospect on Week 6:
This week had a steep learning curve. Through code reviews, I learnt better coding practices. There were no major roadblocks.

Week 7 Plan:
- [x] Code Review

Works
- Worked majorly upon fixing code after reviews.
- Review ready PR [Instructor: comment on responses: support entering comments for each response from view GQR #8872](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8897)
- Opened PR [Instructor: Question view: visibility icon does not appear for new comments #8899](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8934)

Retrospect on Week 7:
Code looks clean now. I guess it would take some more time to get the main PR merged. I plan to work on this along with other issues related to comments feature.
