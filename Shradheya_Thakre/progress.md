- [x] Merged PR: [Remove JS Coverage requirement #8768](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues/8768)

Week 1 Retrospect:

Due to other commitments for the entire week, I wasn't able to put in enough time to write any tests. Hence I spent the time in investigating what tests should be added/modified. I think this time paid off as I was able to catch up for this week by creating multiple PR's for the pre existing issues in the following week.

I also spent the week in reviewing the Testing related PR's which were pending for a long time and some of which were blocking other PR's from getting merged(Eg. #8813)


Week 2 Plan:
- [x]Adding more Test cases based on `TODO` present in Testing code (Issues will be created accordingly)
  - [x] [BackDoorTest: add test for deletion of Feedback Session](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues/8842)
  - [x] [Testing: Improve instructions and process #8844](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues/8844)
- [x] Review PR's related to Testing which have been left untouched for a long time

Week 2 Work:

- [x] Fixed Critical Bug unrelated to initial project proposal. Merged PR: [Instructor: view results: fix bug: sorting results by team is broken](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8840)
- [x] Merged PR: [BackDoorTest: add test for deletion of Feedback Session](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8843)
- [x] Authored 3 other PR

Week 2 Retrospect:

During this week I created 4-5 PR's related to testing however only few were merged due to the time taken to review PR's. Hence I will be devoting Week 3 to ensure all open PR's are reviewed and merged.

I think the review process slowed me down but also it let me catch up on the work that needed to be done in Week 1.
